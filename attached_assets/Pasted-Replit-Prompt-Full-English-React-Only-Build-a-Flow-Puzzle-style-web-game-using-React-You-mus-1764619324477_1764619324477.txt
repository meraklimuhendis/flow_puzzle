Replit Prompt (Full English + React Only)

Build a Flow Puzzle style web game using React. You must act as a UI/UX expert and a modern front-end engineer. Follow every rule and requirement below exactly.

🎮 Game Definition

Create a Flow Puzzle game where the player connects two matching letters of the same color by drawing a continuous path on the grid. Paths cannot intersect. The puzzle is completed when all pairs are connected.

⭐ Difficulty Levels

There will be three difficulty levels:

Easy: 5x5 grid, 4 pairs of letters

Medium: 6x6 grid, 5 pairs

Hard: 7x7 grid, 6 pairs

Difficulty selector must be placed at the top:
Easy | Medium | Hard

When selected, display only that puzzle centered on the page.

🧩 UI Guidelines (IMPORTANT)

Design the UI as if you are building a premium puzzle game. Requirements:

Fully centered puzzle grid

Rounded square tiles (not sharp squares)

Colored letter cells, empty tiles stay white

Pastel colors and modern style

Soft shadows

Smooth transitions and animations

Fluid drawing interaction

Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile

Touch + mouse drawing support

Apple / Flow Free inspired design

The UI must look clean, minimalistic, and modern.

🧠 Interaction Rules

User drags from a letter cell to draw a path

If the path is valid, keep it

If the path is invalid, remove it

If a new path crosses an old one, replace the old one

When all paths are complete:

The puzzle is solved

The timer is automatically paused

⏱ Timer Rules

Place the timer under the puzzle.
It must have:

Start

Pause

Reset

When puzzle is solved:

Automatically stop the timer

🧱 Required Implementation

This MUST be written in React only (no Vanilla JS).

Use proper component structure:

/src
  /components
    Grid.jsx
    Tile.jsx
    Timer.jsx
    DifficultySelector.jsx
  /logic
    gameEngine.js   // connection rules, validation
    levels.js       // level definitions
  App.jsx
  index.jsx
  style.css


No messy single-file implementation.
Clean code, modular design.

📱 Responsive Requirements

Puzzle should scale to fit mobile screens perfectly

Smooth touch drawing

Works in both portrait and landscape

🧪 Level System

You can use static sample levels for now.
Each difficulty level must load its own puzzle layout.

✨ Visual Theme

Follow these style principles:

Minimalistic

Pastel colors

Smooth and soft rounded shapes

Light shadow depth

No outdated styling

No Bootstrap

🚀 Final Requirement

Deliver a fully working Flow Puzzle game in React.

Complete code

All components and logic included

The result must run immediately when I press "Run"

No placeholder text or unfinished parts

No TODO comments

If you understand these requirements, generate the entire working React project in Replit and produce all files and components in one output.
